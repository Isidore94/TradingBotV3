# Checkpoint marker

[`plan.md`](plan.md) owns all status, roadmap, and promotion policy. The full
implemented/remaining inventory lives in Section 3, and the ordered work queue
in Section 12. This file is only the small, frequently refreshed checkpoint
stamp; it must not duplicate the roadmap.

## Current checkpoint

- Branch: `milestone-1-observability`, cut from `main` at `ed89265`. The Sol
  integration and GUI product work it was based on is now merged into `main`.
- Integration base: `3443c69` (an ancestor of `main`).
- Date: 2026-07-30
- Test baseline: **1249 passed, 5 subtests passed**
  (`.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/ -q`, ~38s)
- Smoke: **7/7** (`scripts/smoke_check.py`)
- Live validation: **IN PROGRESS** — the July 13 session verified single-owner
  scheduled scans, durable run IDs/PIDs, accurate heartbeat state, M5 completed-
  candle processing, SPY shadow coverage, Greatness shadow coverage, and the
  composed operations audit (**6/6 healthy** before the Away-report check was
  added), and the 13:00 final scan
  completed successfully in 1111.4s with one durable worker/run ID and zero
  true log errors. The persisted focus feed had 166/166 v2-tagged rows and no
  empty tag lists. The expanded eight-check audit and transactional Away publication
  still need a restarted-app/live verification. Physical failure-matrix and
  two-machine Drive drills remain outstanding.
- Shadow engines: SPY state and Greatness both logging; neither is promoted.
- Registry adoption: open scan, auto-populate, and near-extreme writers now
  dual-write in shadow; text watchlists remain authoritative.
- Aggressive auto-populate: completed-M5 repeated HOD/LOD pressure and
  legacy-SPY-pullback extreme holders now feed regime-inverted long/short
  candidates, while scheduled rotation and triple-VWAP invalidation remain
  unchanged. Golden coverage here is narrow, not general: exactly one pure
  function, `autopilot_core.build_aggressive_regime_candidates`, is pinned to
  `tests/fixtures/aggressive_watchlist_candidates_v1.json` (consumed by
  `tests/test_auto_populate_watchlists.py`). The surrounding writer, rotation,
  and invalidation paths have no golden fixture.
- Technical Integrity v1: a research-only completed-M5 level-respect score now
  publishes market/sector/industry/stock hierarchy plus bullish/bearish break
  pressure. Auto regime and Technicals are visible on every GUI page; hover
  shows coverage and strongest/weakest industries, while clicking opens the
  searchable full hierarchy. Append-only predictions and
  outcomes feed daily plus on-demand point-in-time calibration, with a 100-event
  / 5-session / both-outcome review floor and no automatic tuning path.
- Scanner reliability: compact tracker scoring snapshot, true trigger-date
  freshness, invalid-side history sanitation, shared output-computation reuse,
  atomic signal/feature/watchlist writes, and detailed output timings landed.
- Away reliability: report + metadata publish transaction, hash/readback
  audit, honest GUI status, phone-sized scan/tracker health, hour-aligned
  07:00-through-close reports, persisted Away profile, simulated
  expiry/clock-skew/sleep-wake/failure tests, and swing-first candidate
  ordering with honest empty/unscanned states landed.
- Writer ownership is fail-closed **only at the publisher boundary**
  (`scripts/autopilot_core.py:2332-2341`): `LeaseUnavailable` or any other
  exception out of `acquire()` aborts the Away publish. The lease module itself
  fails **open**. `scripts/writer_lease.py:37-41` swallows `OSError`,
  `JSONDecodeError` and `ValueError` and returns `None`, so a corrupt or
  half-synced lease file reads as "no lease" and `acquire()` overwrites it; the
  guard at `:74-85` also requires a truthy `holder` and a parseable
  `expires_at`, so a blank holder or a malformed timestamp (`_parse_ts` returns
  `None`) skips the raise and lets the caller take the lease. Module-level
  fail-closed is outstanding.
- GUI trust foundation: the Industry Board now has single-flight startup/hourly
  refresh, atomic last-good files, snapshot freshness/Health evidence, and
  numeric strongest/weakest sorting. Master focus duplicates now merge by
  opportunity thesis/anchor instead of surviving solely because their buckets
  differ.
- Bounce/entry trust: BounceBot now defaults to Auto with a separate N/A user
  mode, logs every manual environment selection beside Auto's same-moment
  evidence, makes automatic completed-bar entry monitoring explicit, and hides
  manual pullback/bounce windows under Advanced. D1 Focus now accepts only
  final Favorite/High Conviction bucket upgrades; developing A/S target touches
  are named and logged as research-only evidence and cannot enter Alert Center
  or Auto/Away alert summaries. Generic champion D1 flags remain unchanged.
- Research/journal UX: every Setup Tracker, Day Trade Tracker, and Move
  Forensics row now has the same novice-friendly execution/evidence explanation;
  Setup Tracker summarizes qualified leaders in plain English. Journal schema
  v2 preserves append-only opportunity lifecycle events plus structured GUI
  reviews, with broker-derived Taken/Closed events idempotent across rebuilds.
- Optional A.I. review: a top-level A.I. Summary tab now attaches either
  ChatGPT/OpenAI or Claude/Anthropic to explicit user-selected evidence scopes.
  It previews the exact bounded package, stores saved keys in Windows Credential
  Manager, validates structured results and every source ID, and exports the
  summary/evidence/manifest without any write path back into bot decisions.
- Advisory industry RS/RW: the RS Window now excludes forming M5 bars and
  prior-session spillover from its automatic window, declares a deterministic
  primary industry, ranks all available intraday industry composites, and shows
  industry-vs-SPY plus stock-vs-industry with member/timestamp coverage. The
  atomic snapshot feeds replay and A.I. evidence only; production scoring,
  alerts, and promotion remain unchanged pending the roadmap gates. RS Window,
  Auto Pilot, and the swing-first Drive report expose the same source-board ID
  and flag any stale-source mismatch.
- Setup tags: v2 semantic family/trigger/confirmation tags are integrated with
  provenance while preserving the raw trigger signals separately.
- Next queue: finish the Section 6 operational drills, collect/audit Technical
  Integrity live evidence before considering any tuning, complete remaining
  CandidateRegistry writer adoption, and finish Greatness readiness gates.
